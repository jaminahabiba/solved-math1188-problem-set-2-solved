In the information security department in a software company, a single crucial program works only 85% of the time. In order to enhance the reliability of the system, it is decided that 3 programs will be executed in parallel such that the system fails only if they all fail. Assume the programs act independently and that they are equivalent in the sense that all 3 of them have an 85% success rate. Consider the random variable X as the number of programs out of 3 that fail.

<ul>

 <li>Write out a probability function for the random variable <em>X</em>.</li>

</ul>

A manufacturing company uses an acceptance scheme on items from a production line before they are shipped. The plan is a two-stage one. Boxes of 25 items are ready for shipment, and a sample of 3 items is tested for defectives. If any defectives are found, the entire box is sent back for 100% screening. If no defectives are found, the box is shipped.
